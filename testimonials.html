					Testimonials

				<p>
					"James Clark has assisted the Commons Social Change Library to significantly grow our audience. James undertook a thorough review of our social media and promotional activities and provided a number of valuable recommendations that were appropriate to our small team and limited budget. He also carried out practical work to set up our advertising, newsletter subscription and registration processes, saving us time and extending our reach. It was a relief to work with someone who knows his stuff, translates technical information for rookies, and trouble-shoots problems quickly. I would recommend James for all sorts of projects that fit his broad and impressive skillset."

					"He is a delight to work with: a supportive and skilled manager, a brilliant strategist, and committed to doing the work to get results. He isn&rsquo;t afraid to push boundaries, try new ideas, and challenge outdated assumptions, to help the organisation excel. When he took the lead on a project, he was successful in motivating and coordinating large global teams of international digital campaigners and organisers to get results. I would jump at the chance to work with James again. He&rsquo;s an asset to your team."

					"I had the pleasure of working with James for a year at 350.org. He was my manager and supported me on digital campaign strategies. I&rsquo;m particularly impressed by James&rsquo; ability to handle the toughest projects well, making sure that strategies and tactics fit the campaign objectives. I am sure any team would be lucky to have James as a team member or a leader. He earns my highest recommendation."
